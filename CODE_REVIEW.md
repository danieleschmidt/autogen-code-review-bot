# Code Review

## Engineer Persona

### Static Analysis
- `ruff check .` → no style issues found.
- `bandit -r src -q` → 2 low-severity warnings about using `subprocess`.
- `radon cc -s -a src` → all modules graded `A` for cyclomatic complexity.

### Code Quality
- Implementation provides a basic dual-agent architecture and PR analysis utilities.
- Packaging via `pyproject.toml` makes the project installable, though some files lack trailing newlines.

## Product Manager Persona
- `planner.py` generates a sprint board and machine‑readable acceptance criteria for multi‑language support tasks.
- The backlog items are correctly listed in `SPRINT_BOARD.md` but remain unimplemented, so acceptance criteria in `tests/sprint_acceptance_criteria.json` are not yet satisfied.
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` lists completed tasks and upcoming phases.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` is absent, so architectural alignment cannot be verified.

## Conclusion
The branch builds cleanly with minor security warnings. Upcoming work should implement the backlog tasks and add tests to satisfy the defined acceptance criteria. Ensure files end with a newline for consistency.
