1. Analyze monitoring dashboards and metrics
2. Review recent deployments and changes
3. Check dependency service status
4. Identify root cause hypothesis

**Mitigation Phase (15-30 minutes):**
1. Implement immediate workaround if available
2. Rollback recent changes if suspected cause
3. Scale resources if capacity issue
4. Engage additional team members if needed

**Resolution Phase (30+ minutes):**
1. Implement permanent fix
2. Verify service restoration
3. Monitor for stability
4. Update incident documentation

### P2/P3 Incident Response

**Assessment (0-10 minutes):**
1. Evaluate impact and urgency
2. Determine if escalation needed
3. Plan investigation approach
4. Communicate status to stakeholders

**Resolution (10-60 minutes):**
1. Investigate and identify root cause
2. Implement appropriate fix
3. Test and validate resolution
4. Monitor for regression

## Common Issues and Solutions

### GitHub API Rate Limiting

**Symptoms:**
- HTTP 403 responses from GitHub API
- "API rate limit exceeded" error messages
- Delayed or failed PR analysis

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check current rate limit status
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/rate_limit

# Check application logs for rate limit errors
kubectl logs -f deployment/autogen-bot | grep "rate.limit"
```

**Resolution:**
1. Verify GitHub App installation and permissions
2. Implement exponential backoff in API calls
3. Consider GitHub Enterprise for higher limits
4. Distribute load across multiple GitHub Apps

### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms:**
- Memory usage >80% sustained
- Out of memory errors in logs
- Container restarts due to memory limits

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check memory usage patterns
kubectl top pods -n autogen-bot

# Analyze memory consumption
kubectl exec -it pod/autogen-bot -- ps aux --sort=-%mem

# Review heap dumps if available
kubectl exec -it pod/autogen-bot -- cat /tmp/heapdump.hprof
```

**Resolution:**
1. Increase memory limits temporarily
2. Analyze code for memory leaks
3. Optimize caching strategies
4. Implement memory monitoring alerts

### Webhook Processing Delays

**Symptoms:**
- Increasing queue lengths
- Delayed PR analysis
- Webhook timeout errors

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check queue metrics
kubectl exec -it pod/autogen-bot -- redis-cli -c llen webhook_queue

# Analyze processing times
kubectl logs -f deployment/autogen-bot | grep "processing_time"

# Check worker health
kubectl get pods -l app=autogen-bot-worker
```

**Resolution:**
1. Scale up worker instances
2. Optimize analysis algorithms
3. Implement priority queuing
4. Add circuit breakers for failing repositories

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Procedures

**Automated Backups:**
- Configuration data: Daily at 02:00 UTC
- Application state: Hourly snapshots
- Logs and metrics: 30-day retention
- Secrets and certificates: Weekly encrypted backup

**Backup Verification:**
- Monthly restore testing
- Automated backup integrity checks
- Cross-region backup replication
- Recovery time objective validation

### Recovery Procedures

**Service Recovery Steps:**
1. Assess scope and impact of outage
2. Activate disaster recovery team
3. Restore from latest valid backup
4. Verify data integrity and consistency
5. Gradually restore traffic
6. Monitor for issues and performance

**Data Recovery:**
```bash
# Restore configuration from backup
kubectl apply -f /backup/configs/latest/

# Restore application state
redis-cli --rdb /backup/redis/latest.rdb

# Verify service health
kubectl get pods -n autogen-bot
curl -f https://api.autogen-bot.com/health
```

## Capacity Planning

### Scaling Triggers

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- CPU usage >70% for >10 minutes
- Request queue length >100
- Response time p95 >3s sustained

**Vertical Scaling:**
- Memory usage >80% sustained
- Persistent high resource utilization
- Single-instance bottlenecks

### Performance Optimization

**Code-Level Optimizations:**
- Implement request coalescing
- Optimize database queries
- Use async processing where possible
- Cache frequently accessed data

**Infrastructure Optimizations:**
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement database read replicas
- Optimize container resource limits
- Use appropriate instance types

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

**Daily:**
- Monitor service health and performance
- Review error logs and alerts
- Check backup completion status
- Validate certificate expiration dates

**Weekly:**
- Update security patches
- Review capacity utilization trends
- Analyze performance metrics
- Update documentation as needed

**Monthly:**
- Conduct disaster recovery testing
- Review and update runbooks
- Analyze incident trends and patterns
- Plan capacity upgrades if needed

### Deployment Procedures

**Pre-deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Tests passing (>95% coverage)
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run smoke tests and validation
3. Deploy to canary environment (5% traffic)
4. Monitor metrics for 15 minutes
5. Gradually increase traffic to 100%
6. Monitor for 30 minutes post-deployment

**Post-deployment Verification:**
- Service health checks passing
- Key metrics within normal ranges
- No increase in error rates
- User-facing functionality working
