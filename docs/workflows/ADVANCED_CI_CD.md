# Advanced CI/CD Patterns

## Overview
This document provides advanced CI/CD patterns and deployment strategies for the AutoGen Code Review Bot, building upon the existing foundation for enterprise-scale deployments.

## Advanced Workflow Architecture

### Multi-Environment Pipeline
```yaml
# Advanced deployment strategy with multiple environments
environments:
  development:
    - feature-branch-validation
    - automated-testing
    - security-scanning
  
  staging:
    - integration-testing  
    - performance-testing
    - security-validation
    - approval-gates
  
  production:
    - blue-green-deployment
    - canary-releases
    - rollback-strategies
    - monitoring-validation
```

### Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Zero-downtime deployments** with instant rollback capability
- **Traffic switching** between environments
- **Database migration** handling with rollback procedures
- **Health check validation** before traffic routing

#### Canary Releases
- **Progressive traffic shifting** (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- **Automated rollback** on metric threshold breach
- **A/B testing** integration for feature validation
- **Real-time monitoring** of deployment health

#### Feature Flags Integration
- **Runtime feature toggling** without deployments
- **Progressive feature rollout** to user segments
- **Kill switches** for immediate feature disabling
- **Configuration-driven** behavior changes

## Advanced Security Practices

### Supply Chain Security
- **SLSA Level 3** compliance for build integrity
- **Dependency provenance** tracking and validation
- **Container image** signing with Cosign
- **SBOM generation** for vulnerability tracking

### Zero-Trust Architecture
- **Service mesh** implementation with mTLS
- **Identity-based** access control (SPIFFE/SPIRE)
- **Network segmentation** with micro-perimeters
- **Runtime security** monitoring and enforcement

### Compliance Automation
- **SOC 2 Type II** automated evidence collection
- **GDPR compliance** validation and reporting
- **ISO 27001** control implementation verification
- **PCI DSS** (if applicable) automated compliance checks

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Intelligent Scaling
```yaml
# Advanced autoscaling configuration
scaling_policies:
  horizontal:
    - metric: cpu_utilization
      threshold: 70%
      scale_up: 2x
      scale_down: 0.5x
    
    - metric: memory_utilization  
      threshold: 80%
      scale_up: 1.5x
      scale_down: 0.7x
    
    - metric: queue_depth
      threshold: 100
      scale_up: 3x
      scale_down: immediate
  
  vertical:
    - auto_resource_adjustment: true
    - cpu_bounds: [0.5, 4.0]
    - memory_bounds: [1Gi, 8Gi]
```

### Caching Strategies
- **Multi-tier caching** (L1: memory, L2: Redis, L3: CDN)
- **Cache warming** strategies for predictable load
- **Intelligent invalidation** based on content dependencies
- **Regional cache** distribution for global performance

### Database Optimization
- **Read replicas** for analytics and reporting workloads
- **Connection pooling** with adaptive sizing
- **Query optimization** with automated index suggestions
- **Partition strategies** for large dataset management

## Monitoring and Observability

### SRE Practices
```yaml
# Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
slos:
  availability: 99.9%
  latency_p99: 500ms
  error_rate: 0.1%
  throughput: 1000_rps

# Error budgets and alerting
error_budgets:
  monthly_downtime: 43.2_minutes
  alert_thresholds:
    - burn_rate_1h: 14.4x
    - burn_rate_6h: 6x
    - burn_rate_24h: 3x
```

### Distributed Tracing
- **OpenTelemetry** integration with Jaeger/Zipkin
- **Cross-service** request correlation
- **Performance bottleneck** identification
- **Dependency mapping** and service health visualization

### Chaos Engineering
- **Controlled failure** injection with Chaos Monkey
- **Network partition** simulation
- **Resource exhaustion** testing
- **Recovery time** measurement and optimization

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Right-Sizing
- **Automated resource** recommendation based on usage patterns
- **Spot instance** utilization for non-critical workloads
- **Reserved capacity** planning for predictable loads
- **Multi-cloud** cost comparison and optimization

### Development Environment Optimization
- **On-demand environments** with automatic shutdown
- **Resource sharing** for development and testing
- **Container image** optimization for faster deployments
- **Build cache** optimization to reduce CI/CD costs
