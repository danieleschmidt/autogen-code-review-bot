# ADR-001: Dual-Agent Architecture for Code Review

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The AutoGen Code Review Bot needs to provide comprehensive and balanced code review feedback. Single-agent systems often struggle with balancing different aspects of code quality, such as functionality versus maintainability, or performance versus readability.

## Decision
We will implement a dual-agent architecture consisting of:

1. **Coder Agent**: Focuses on functionality, implementation logic, bug detection, and edge cases
2. **Reviewer Agent**: Emphasizes code quality, security, performance, and adherence to standards

These agents will collaborate through structured conversations to reach consensus on review findings.

## Rationale
- **Specialization**: Each agent can develop expertise in specific areas
- **Balanced Perspective**: Different viewpoints ensure comprehensive analysis
- **Quality Assurance**: Agent discussions help validate findings and reduce false positives
- **Scalability**: Each agent can be optimized independently for their domain

## Consequences

### Positive
- More thorough and balanced code reviews
- Reduced false positives through agent consensus
- Clear separation of concerns in the analysis pipeline
- Ability to fine-tune each agent's behavior independently

### Negative
- Increased computational overhead for dual analysis
- More complex conversation management
- Potential for agent disagreements requiring resolution logic
- Higher operational complexity

## Implementation Details
- Use Microsoft AutoGen framework for agent conversations
- Implement configurable agent templates and personalities
- Create conversation protocols for structured agent interaction
- Add consensus-building mechanisms for conflicting recommendations

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Single Agent**: Simpler but less comprehensive analysis
2. **Multi-Agent (3+)**: More specialized but exponentially more complex
3. **Pipeline Architecture**: Sequential processing without collaboration
