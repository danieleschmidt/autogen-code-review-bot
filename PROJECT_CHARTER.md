# Project Charter: AutoGen Code Review Bot

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: AutoGen Code Review Bot  
**Project Type**: Open Source Developer Tool  
**Start Date**: 2024  
**Current Phase**: Active Development  

## Problem Statement

Manual code reviews are time-consuming, inconsistent, and often miss critical issues due to human oversight. Development teams need an intelligent, automated system that can provide comprehensive code analysis while maintaining the collaborative aspects of human review.

## Solution Approach

The AutoGen Code Review Bot leverages Microsoft AutoGen's multi-agent framework to create specialized "Coder" and "Reviewer" agents that collaborate to analyze pull requests. This dual-agent approach ensures both functionality and quality concerns are thoroughly addressed.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Automated pull request analysis and review
- Multi-language support (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Ruby)
- GitHub integration via webhooks
- Security vulnerability detection
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Code quality and style compliance
- Intelligent caching and parallel processing
- Comprehensive documentation and testing

### Out of Scope
- Direct code modification or auto-fixing
- Support for version control systems other than Git
- Enterprise SSO integration (future consideration)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Custom LLM model training

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Review Quality**: >85% accuracy in identifying genuine issues
2. **Performance**: <30 seconds average review time per PR
3. **Adoption**: Successfully deployed in >10 repositories
4. **Reliability**: >99% uptime for webhook processing
