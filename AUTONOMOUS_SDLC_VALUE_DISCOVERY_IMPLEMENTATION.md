### Value Discovery Engine Capabilities

#### 🔍 Multi-Source Signal Harvesting
```python
# Continuous discovery from 5 primary sources:
✅ Git History Analysis      # TODO/FIXME/HACK markers
✅ Static Analysis          # ruff, mypy, bandit integration  
✅ Security Scanning        # Vulnerability detection
✅ Performance Monitoring   # Benchmark regression analysis
✅ External Signals        # Maintenance and housekeeping
```

#### 🎯 Advanced Scoring Model
```python
# Hybrid WSJF + ICE + Technical Debt scoring:
Composite Score = (
    0.5 * WSJF_Score +           # Weighted Shortest Job First
    0.1 * ICE_Score +            # Impact × Confidence × Ease  
    0.3 * Technical_Debt_Score + # Debt impact with hotspot weighting
    0.1 * Security_Multiplier    # 2x boost for security items
)
```

#### ⚡ Autonomous Execution Pipeline
```bash
# 5-phase autonomous workflow:
1. Discovery  → Multi-source signal harvesting (hourly)
2. Scoring    → Hybrid value calculation (real-time)  
3. Selection  → Risk-adjusted prioritization (continuous)
4. Execution  → Automated improvement application (safe)
5. Learning   → Outcome tracking and model refinement (continuous)
```
