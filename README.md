# AutoGen-Code-Review-Bot

Two-agent "coder" + "reviewer" loop using Microsoft AutoGen for automated PR critiques and code quality enhancement.

## Features

- **Dual-Agent Architecture**: Specialized "Coder" and "Reviewer" agents with distinct personalities and expertise
- **Automated PR Analysis**: Comprehensive pull request review with security, performance, and style feedback
- **Multi-Language Support**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Ruby, and more
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamless webhook integration for automatic PR reviews
- **Configurable Rules**: Customizable review criteria and coding standards
- **Learning System**: Agents improve through feedback loops and historical review data

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies and dev tools
pip install -e .[dev]

# Configure GitHub webhook
python setup_webhook.py --repo your-org/your-repo

# Start the review bot
python bot.py --config config/default.yaml
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
Run code style and secret scanning checks before committing:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Agent Roles

### Coder Agent
- Focuses on functionality and implementation details
- Suggests code improvements and refactoring opportunities
- Identifies potential bugs and edge cases

### Reviewer Agent
- Emphasizes code quality, maintainability, and best practices
- Checks for security vulnerabilities and performance issues
- Ensures adherence to team coding standards

## Configuration

```yaml
# config/review_config.yaml
agents:
  coder:
    model: "gpt-4"
    temperature: 0.3
    focus_areas: ["functionality", "bugs", "edge_cases"]
  
  reviewer:
    model: "gpt-4"
    temperature: 0.1
    focus_areas: ["security", "performance", "standards"]

github:
  webhook_secret: "your_webhook_secret"  # pragma: allowlist secret
  bot_token: "your_github_token"  # pragma: allowlist secret

review_criteria:
  security_scan: true
  performance_check: true
  test_coverage: true
  documentation: true
```

### Linter Configuration

The bot uses language-specific linters to check code style. A YAML file can
override the default mapping of languages to linting tools:

```yaml
# linters.yaml
linters:
  python: ruff
  javascript: eslint
  typescript: eslint
  go: golangci-lint
  ruby: rubocop
```

Pass the path to this file when invoking `analyze_pr` to customize which
linters run for each language.
Unspecified languages fall back to the built-in defaults for Python,
JavaScript, and TypeScript.

Example usage:

```python
from autogen_code_review_bot import analyze_pr

# Basic analysis with caching and parallel execution (both enabled by default)
result = analyze_pr("/path/to/repo", config_path="linters.yaml")
print(result.style.output)

# Configure execution options
result = analyze_pr("/path/to/repo", use_cache=False, use_parallel=False)

# Parallel execution only (fast for repos with multiple languages)
result = analyze_pr("/path/to/repo", use_cache=False, use_parallel=True)
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### Intelligent Caching

The bot includes an intelligent caching system that stores linter results by commit hash and configuration:

- **Cache Location**: `~/.cache/autogen-review/` (configurable)
- **Cache Duration**: 24 hours (configurable)  
- **Cache Key**: Based on commit hash + linter configuration hash
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired entries are automatically removed

#### Parallel Execution

For repositories with multiple programming languages, the bot uses parallel execution to run linters concurrently:

- **Language-Level Parallelism**: Each language's linter runs in its own thread
- **Check-Level Parallelism**: Security, style, and performance checks run simultaneously
- **Configurable Workers**: Automatically optimized based on detected languages
- **Thread Safety**: All operations are thread-safe and cache-compatible

```python
from autogen_code_review_bot.caching import LinterCache

# Configure custom cache settings
cache = LinterCache(cache_dir="/tmp/my-cache", ttl_hours=48)

# Manual cache management
cache.cleanup()  # Remove expired entries
cache.clear()    # Remove all entries

# Performance tuning examples
result = analyze_pr("/path/to/repo", use_parallel=True)   # Fast for multi-language repos
result = analyze_pr("/path/to/repo", use_parallel=False)  # Sequential for debugging
```

**Performance Benefits:**
- **Caching**: 5x+ speedup for repeated analyses on same commit
- **Parallel Execution**: 2-3x speedup for multi-language repositories
- **Combined**: Up to 15x speedup in optimal conditions

## Usage Examples

### Manual Review
```bash
# Review a specific PR
python review_pr.py --pr-number 123 --repo owner/repo

# Review local changes
python review_local.py --path ./src --diff HEAD~1
```

### GitHub Integration
The bot automatically triggers on:
- New pull requests
- Push events to PR branches
- Review requests

You can also run the analysis manually and post the results to a pull request:

```python
from autogen_code_review_bot.github_integration import analyze_and_comment

# GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable must be set
analyze_and_comment('/path/to/repo', 'owner/repo', 123)
```
